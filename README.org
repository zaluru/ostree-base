#+title: ostree base
[[https://github.com/zaluru/ostree-base/actions/workflows/main.yml][file:https://github.com/zaluru/ostree-base/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg]]

Minimal base for future ostree setups

This base image is then used in my [[https://github.com/zaluru/ostree-workstation][ostree-workstation repo]] which configures further

For now it is mostly a copy of [[https://github.com/martinpitt/ostree-pitti-workstation][this]] repo by [[https://github.com/martinpitt][martinpitt]]

When fedora IoT oci containers become available, I may switch to them instead of building my own base image
